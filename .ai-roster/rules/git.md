# Git Rules (all agents, all stages)

1. **Atomic commits — always.** One commit = one logical change (one slice, one doc, one fix).
   Never bundle unrelated files or mix a feature with a drive-by cleanup; split them into
   separate commits. If a commit message needs the word "and" between two unrelated clauses,
   it should be two commits.
2. **Explicit staging only.** Stage files by path (`git add -- <file>...`), never `git add .`
   or `git add -A`. `github_flow.sh submit` enforces this — go through it.
3. **Commit messages.** Imperative one-line summary; body only when the diff can't explain
   itself. Work commits reference their issue (`Refs #<n>` — `submit` appends this).
4. **Branches.** One issue = one branch (`issue-<n>`), short-lived, created off `main` via
   `github_flow.sh start`. Rebase on `main` before `submit`; merge promptly after review.
5. **No force-push** on shared branches. Exception: an engineer amending their own unmerged
   `issue-<n>` after QA rejection (QA's `qa-checkout` force-resets its alias to match) — but any
   `test(e2e)` commit QA pushed onto the branch must SURVIVE the amend: rebase your fix on top
   of it (or cherry-pick it back) and push with `--force-with-lease`. Deleting or weakening a QA
   e2e test to get green is a gate violation — if a test contradicts the spec, say so on the
   issue instead.
6. **Never commit secrets** — tokens, `.env` files, credential files. `.env*` is gitignored;
   if a secret lands in a commit anyway, stop and tell the founder immediately (rotation needed),
   don't just delete the file in a follow-up commit.
